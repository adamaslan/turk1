# 100-Episode Vocabulary Podcast: 10,000 Words

## Mastering French, Spanish & Turkish Through Culture, Art, and Life

**Method:** Tiered Distribution -- 20 Anchor Words + 80 Satellite Words per episode.
Each episode is a mental folder. Anchor words are high-frequency, cross-language cognates or essential building blocks. Satellite words orbit the theme and reinforce the anchors through context.

**Trilingual Optimization Notes:**
- **French first:** Episodes lean into Romance-language cognates shared with Spanish (~60% lexical overlap). Learning French vocabulary creates a bridge to Spanish.
- **Spanish second:** Each episode flags false cognates (faux amis) between French and Spanish and highlights where the two diverge.
- **Turkish third:** Turkish is agglutinative with no Romance roots. Episodes include dedicated Turkish structural notes -- suffixes, vowel harmony patterns, and loan words from French/Arabic that appear in all three languages (e.g., *bureau/buro*, *politique/politika*).
- **Shared loan words** across all three languages are flagged with a triple-star marker in each episode to accelerate retention.

## Appendix A: Trilingual Optimization Strategy

### French-Spanish Bridge Words
French and Spanish share approximately 75% lexical similarity through Latin roots. Each episode highlights:
- **Direct cognates**: words that are nearly identical (FR *information* / ES *informacion*)
- **Near cognates**: words with predictable spelling shifts (FR *-tion* = ES *-cion*, FR *-ment* = ES *-mente*)
- **False friends**: words that look similar but differ in meaning (FR *assister* = to attend; ES *asistir* = to attend, but also to assist)

### Turkish Integration Strategy
Turkish belongs to a different language family (Turkic) with no Romance roots. The strategy:
1. **French loan words in Turkish**: ~5,000 French-origin words exist in Turkish (*kuafor, asansor, garson, butce, sezaryen*)
2. **Arabic/Persian shared roots**: Words entering French through Arabic that also exist in Turkish (*algebra/cebir, algorithm/algoritma*)
3. **International vocabulary**: Technical, scientific, and cultural terms shared globally
4. **Structural patterns**: Turkish agglutination explained through French/Spanish equivalents

### Episode Structure (Each Episode)
1. **Cold open** (2 min): A scenario/story using the episode's words in context
2. **Anchor words** (8 min): 20 key words with pronunciation, definition, example sentence
3. **Satellite expansion** (10 min): 80 related words in thematic clusters
4. **Trilingual bridge** (5 min): Cognates, false friends, and Turkish connections
5. **Practice round** (5 min): Fill-in-the-blank, synonym match, scenario response
